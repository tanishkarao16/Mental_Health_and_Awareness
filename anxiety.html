                                        <p>Anxiety can be the result of challenging situations faced by a person - including trauma, stress, and illness. Exposure to difficult events for a long period of time can trigger an anxiety disorder in an individual.</p>

                                        <h5>PHSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS.</h5>
                                        <p>When people believe that they lack control over situations in general, anxiety may be experienced. Negative thought patterns can also lead one to feel anxious when faced with a difficult situation. Lack of belief in one's ability to cope is linked to anxiety too.</p>

                                        <h5>EXPOSURE THERAPY.</h5>
                                        <p>In this approach, people are taught to gradually face situations that arouse anxiety. If done systematically, it can help people overcome anxiety.</p>
